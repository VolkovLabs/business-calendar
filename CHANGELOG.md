- Quick links: Enable quick links to follow the data link when you click the event rather than opening a modal.

## 0.6.0 (2022-01-28)

### Breaking changes

This release bumps the minimum required Grafana to >=8.0. Grafana 8 introduces a new theming engine for panel plugins.

- If you're running a Grafana version before 8.0, you should stay with v0.5.0.
- If you're running Grafana 8.0 or above, you should update to v0.6.0.

## 0.5.0 (2021-09-06)

### Features / Enhancements

- Data links support (#25)
- **New details view:** Instead of relying on tooltips, this version uses an inline drawer to display additional details. I like this better, but the built-in drawer component has some limitations. I'm not sure I like that it's a modal for example. I might end up creating a custom sidebar component. Let me know what you think about the new design!
